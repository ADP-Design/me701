# ME 701 - Pages

This folder contains content pages for the lectures in ME 701.  Although these
pages are ultimately published to Canvas, they are maintained here for
better control.

All content is defined using Markdown (and all files have the `.md`) extension.
In-class demonstrations often use Jupyter notebooks.  These files will
represent a more "static" picture of the material.
