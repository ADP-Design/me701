# The Open-Source World                                                                    

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

In this lesson, a brief history of Linux and the open-source world is given.
Moreover, students will be guided through the use of software managers within
a Linux environment to install open-source software.

********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

- [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) was
written by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation.
The article provides a nice overview of some of the history (and drama!)
related to Linux, GNU, and the open-source movement.

- The [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)
and the [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) are examples
of open-source licenses often used by developers.  Although they are both
"open," the former is significantly more restrictive by requiring all source
code of developed software to remain open.  In other words, if you wrote a
new program XYZ that incorporates GPL-licensed code, then the source
code for XYZ must, per the license, also be made available.  The MIT license
is much more permissive.  Basically, if you use, adapt, or otherwise include
code licensed this way, all you have to do is include the copyright statement
and license for that software, not the source code for it or any of your
code.

- It was [reported](https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-survey-finds-were-living-in-an-open-source-world/) that
Red Hat, a commercial Linux vendor, found the
world is driven by open-source software.  Historically, open-source solutions
were cheaper, but with the easy, community-driven development of packages,
these solutions also have become the most enabling and advanced.

- Intimately connected to the open-source world is the so-called "hacker culture."
Hacker here does not mean nefarious computational criminal; rather, a hacker
is someone who crafts code in a community of like-minded folks.  A great
series of anecdotes is collected
in [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).
Among the many gems in this book is the proposal of "Linus's Law," which
says that software bugs are easier to fix if more people are looking.
That might seem obvious, but it's not a possible reality if the code can't
be seen outside of a single company!

********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->


  - Students will explore and install open-source software from the
    built-in repositories that are required for the class.
  - Students will identify and install software that is relevant to
    their interests, other classes, research, etc. and report on it.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

  - Have a machine with Linux installed
  - Read [Linux and the GNU System](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html)
  - Skim [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)
  - Skim [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

### Live Activities

  1. Address any issues with Linux installation.
  2. Discuss origin of Linux (the kernel) and GNU (the operating system).
  3. Install one or more open-source packages using the software manager or
     the `apt` utility.
