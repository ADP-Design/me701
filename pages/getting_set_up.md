  1. Introduction to Linux (brief; video provides more detail)
  2. Navigate to instructions for the majority.  This is likely WSL.
  3. Work through the instructions linked to above with the students.  
     Debug situations as is necessary.
  4. Open the Ubuntu terminal.  Update as needed or recommended.
  5. Restart, etc., as needed.
  6. Demonstrate a few applications that preview the `bash` introduction.
  7. Debrief with students about remaining issues.
