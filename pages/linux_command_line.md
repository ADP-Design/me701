# The Linux Command Line                                                                 

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->



## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

An exhaustive resource is [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php),
from which readings will be indicated for several lessons.  The book is quite long,
and so it is most useful to skim it for commands of interest (or to become aware
of commands in the first place).  Then, students can dive in to material that is
either less clear initially or that is of particular interest.


<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will demonstrate their knowledge of basic commands like
    `pwd`, `cd`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?
-->

### Required Preparation

  - Bring a laptop with Linux ready for use.
  - Read Part 1 (pp. 1--124) of [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php). Note, the
    introduction is quite useful, too.
  - Start a "cheat sheet" of the commands that appear to be useful. You can fill
    in details on-the-fly via recorded or in-person instruction.

### Live Activities

  1. Open with discussion of terminals and emulators.
  2. Launch a Linux shell and explore a number of common commands.

### Videos

 - [Lecture, Fall 2020](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/dd1e35f377d640eabd5f6ef967ab64b11d)
   and [slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2019/lectures/TheLinuxCommandLine.ipynb).
   Again, it seems the microphone failed, so I will add a short tutorial video.
