    "# Course Description and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will provide students with the skills needed to apply computation successfully in their research and professional endeavors. This begs the question, “what is computation?” In this course, all we want to do is make the computer do what we want it to do. Our approach doesn’t always have to be the fastest or most elegant—though both are admirable qualities— but it must get the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, students will learn (or review) basic numerical methods and use them to solve problems typical in mechanical and nuclear engineering. Students will also be exposed to a variety of special topics, including graphical user interfaces, visualization tools, and parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Students should at a minimum leave the course with (1) a basic understanding of how to do scientific work on Linux machines, (2) programming skills at a level needed for solving problems typical of engineering, and (3) the ability to select the appropriate language or tool for the job.**"

    "- 10 homeworks (50%)\n",
    "- Midterm Exam (10%)\n",
    "- Final Project (40%)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **homework** is worth 6 points. Homework will be due more frequently in the early, foundational part of the course and will always be announced at least one week before its due date. All homework is due at the beginning of class on the due date via electronic submission. You are allowed to submit one homework up to 48 hours late for full credit; no late homework accepted thereafter unless a class-wide extension is given.  Homework is an individual effort, i.e., what you submit must be your own work. \n",

    "> *Please note*: The homework might be very hard, especially if your\n",

    "  impossible if you get an early start on them!\n",
    "  \n",
    "The **exam** is a short (roughly 30 minute) oral examination in which you will be tested on basic items covered in class. The format will be you and us (me + at least one other examiner) at a computer (yours or mine). You’ll be given some verbal questions along with one or more (very) short tasks to demonstrate what you know. Some of the questions will likely be about your project and homework solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **project** provides an opportunity for you to explore a topic of your choosing, which can be in support of your research. The catch is that it must be computational, and it must tie in all major elements covered in the course. Examples of past work and suggestions for new work will be provided. The project will be graded based on the following rubric (a more detailed rubric for the report will be given later):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proposal (10%): Up to one page description of what you would like to explore with suggestions of how you will do it. I’ve set a due date, but the earlier you submit it, the earlier you can get started.\n",
    "- Draft Report (10%): 4 or 5 page report using the template provided. This should include a brief one page cover letter to the editor (i.e., me). This draft will be reviewed by at least three reviewers (including me). Although both technical and grammatical aspects will be assessed, note that this draft is only worth 10%, so just do your best to get a complete draft in place.\n",
    "- Report Reviews (10%): You get to assess two or more draft reports of your peers and provide them feedback anonymously. This gives you the chance to see how peer review works in the real world. You also get the benefit of having at least two sets of comments beyond the ones I provide.\n",
    "- Final Report (70%): The final draft should address the reviewer comments. You should also include a revised cover letter that specifies exactly how you addressed each point from the reviews. This draft should have perfect grammar, sound technical analysis, a proper bibliography, etc."

    "Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can be reached via the following URL: www.ksu.edu/honor. A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.” A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\n",
